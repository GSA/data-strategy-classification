# data-strategy-classification
A notebook that uses word embeddings and linear algebra to classify comments on OMB's Federal Data Strategy.

## Getting Started
In order to open and run these notebooks, you'll need two things.
 - Python 3
 - Jupyter Notebook

You could get both of these things separately, but I'd recommend downloading [Anaconda's Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) in order to get both in one go.

### Install Dependencies

Once you've got Anaconda, you'll then need to install some supplementary Python packages. Most of these provide the natural language processing functionality. 

```
spacy
nltk
gensim
beautifulsoup4
pyenchant
contractions
```

### Opening the Notebooks
Once you've got Anaconda and the python dependencies listed above, you're ready to open the notebook and run code (assuming you've got the underlying data file.)
See [these instructions](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html) on how to open Juyter.
